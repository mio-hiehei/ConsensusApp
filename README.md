# ConsensusApp
App to randomly assign name entries to different parties and preferences.
This app is the basis for a Planspiel in the context of a seminar of legislative opposition. It randomly assigns names to different party groups and generates a preference score for each participant.

The purpose of this assignment is it to simulate a legislative committee with partisan actors with the ultimate goal to propose a law that shifts the status quo as in spatial analyses of legislative behaviour (i.e. Tsebelis 2002).
